# Half-Life 2 Virtual Reality Mod

Intended for users with HMDs, this mod integrates independent head and weapon tracking and other VR specific tweaks and features into the Half-life 2 series.  The intention is to provide test bed for new VR game mechanics in a universe that has a wide variety of play types and scenarios to test them in.

This can be played as a standing 360 degree experience or seated using a controller to augment your turning.  I'd highly suggest using a controller for the analog movement rather than a keyboard as it really helps with the immersion.

## Installation

Download the installer, when it asks for the directory point it to your "Steam" directory.  Once the install finishes, you'll need to restart steam to have the game show up in your app list.  Make sure your tracking device is active and start the game.  

## In the game

If your device is mounted in way that's not perfectly level you can hit the "L" key to reorient it's current position as level (in regards to tracker pitch and roll).  Aside from that just use your gamepad or mouse + keyboard to move and optionally help turn and your head to look around & shoot.  Everything else plays as usual.

If you're using separate weapon tracking and want to reorient the weapon only with the screen, press the "K" button.


## Supported Trackers

- Hillcrest Labs FSM-6

**Other devices in the queue**
