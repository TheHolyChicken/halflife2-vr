# Half-Life 2 Virtual Reality Mod

Did you ever wish you could really see through the eyes of Gordon Freeman.  This mod creates a virtual reality experience for the Half-Life 2 series (and can be used for other source engine based games like Counter-Strike Source) for use with a head mounted display with a Hillcrest Labs Freespace Tracker.  

This is a standing 360 degree experience of the Half-Life 2 universe, so you'll need enough room to turn all the way around, and you'll have to have an HMD.  For movement I recommend a wiimote nunchuck or a ps move navigator, binary keyboard movement breaks the sense of immersion.  I use the navigator with [MotionInJoy](http://www.motioninjoy.com/) with xbox controller emulation which provides smooth analog movement.  I've included a glovepie script in the misc folder that I use to map the ps move buttons while the navigator emulates the xbox 360 input that source supports natively.

> This is a very early build, if you have any issues or great ideas add them as issues on this github repo so we can improve the experience.

###Things currently in the pipeline
- Independent weapon tracking
- More input smoothing to reduce recalibration jumps
- Optical tracker integration for tracking head position
- Wiimote implementation
