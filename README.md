# Half-Life 2 Virtual Reality Mod

Intended for users with HMDs, this mod integrates independent head and weapon trackers into the Half-life 2 series.  The intention is to provide test bed for new VR game mechanics in a universe that has a wide variety of play types and scenarios to test them in.

This can be played as a standing 360 degree experience or seated using a controller to augment your turning.  I'd highly suggest using a controller for the analog movement rather than a keyboard as it really helps with the immersion.

## Supported Trackers

- Hillcrest Labs FSM-6

Other devices in the queue

- Wiimote + Wiimote Plus (coming soon)
- PS Move
- Oculus Rift (when it's released)

**This is a very early build, if you have any issues or great ideas add them as issues on this github repo so we can improve the experience.**

## Things currently in the pipeline
- Independent weapon tracking
- Movements relative to body position
- Optical tracker integration for tracking head position
- Wiimote implementation
